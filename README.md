This is our Github for our final project in "SYS-265-02: System Admin. & Network Services II - Spring 2024". The members who worked on and completed this project are Jacob, Dylan, and Kevin. The overall goal for this porject was to build a medium-sized enterprise from scratch for a client over a period of some weeks. 
Our team was tasked with demonstrating our integration efforts to a client manager as part of user acceptance testing in a series of milestones.
